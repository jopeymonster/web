			<h2 class="titles-1">About Me</h2>
			<p>Born in Phoenix, Arizona in 1983, my parents were fantastic people that raised me to always learn, help those in need, never be afraid to love and always choose good. Over time, my family changed and grew in ways I would never have predicted but seeing who I have become, I wouldn't ask to change a thing. As I schooled and matured, I begin to explore possibilities of leaving Arizona, and after graduating high school and completing a few years in college, I choose to take an opportunity that would alter my path beyond my comprehension: pursue a career in California.  Who could pass it up?

			<h3>More Info:</h3>
			<p>
				Unofficially, I began working summers at the Phoenix Public Library as a volunteer, mainly for book access but also because I could read on the job! This was before phones had video or internet access, but boy did that change. In my junior year, I interviewed and was accepted into a work study program with a nationwide retail chain and became part of the retail surge in DVD players, flat screen TVs and smart phones! After serving my time to brick-and-mortar retail, I took a brief job with a telemarketer (mostly because the office space had a great view) until I landed with a small e-commerce business that specialized in hockey equipment and gear. This would lead me on the road to hone my business skills and develop a deeper understanding of the future of business: the internet. I worked hard to help my company grow larger and progressed my own business acumen into multi-system marketing strategies, website sales facilitation and corporate business development.
